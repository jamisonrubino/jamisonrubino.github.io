title: My personal projects and goals
--

In grade school, I took an interest in computers, and did the necessary research to build my own desktop by the age of 12. Around the same time, I practiced creative writing, and began looking into basic HTML and CSS to style my own blog. My interest idled for a few years, before picking up again to help my parents cultivate their own online presences and stimulate their businesses. Throughout this process, I acquainted myself with Javascript, PHP and SQL, and settled on the idea of being a professional web developer. After a few years of miscellaneous, collegiate and independent studies and a number of personal site-building projects, I began researching official coding bootcamps. My goal was to find an online program with flexible pacing but a set schedule, and preferable conferences with professors/teachers to keep me focused and timely.
