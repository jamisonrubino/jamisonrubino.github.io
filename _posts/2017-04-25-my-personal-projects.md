Over the years, I built a number of personal websites, with content ranging from gaming networking to poetry and prose and to important issues in the news. Finding a way to streamline the expression of ideas has always appealed to me, and web development is a great practice for doing so. Ultimately, for my personal projects, I imagine myself building and managing a forum for people with relevant and interesting ideas to network and comment on where humanity is steering itself, and share information that would help its members grow individually.

One project to fulfill this dream is a glorified link farm, which I hope to one day maintain with the latest information in a number of fields I find relevant and worth supporting, and hope to occasionally post comments on when the content of the news items doesn't fully express my vision.
