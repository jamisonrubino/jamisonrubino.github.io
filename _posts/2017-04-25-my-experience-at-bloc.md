title: My experience at Bloc
--

In January, 2017, I took the plunge and committed to Bloc's 27-week, full-stack web development bootcamp.

As expected, the course moves quickly, and at times, the material seems shallow for the amount of time given. Without a foundation in HTML, CSS and Javascript, I feel this would have been unmanageable. With time and the right resources, though, this forces students to think critically, find official documentation, and explore other developers' troubleshooting threads on sites like StackOverflow. For my level of experience, this curriculum is almost ideal.

A big component of Bloc's approach to teaching is bi-weekly (for the 27-week track) mentor meetings, which help clarify misunderstandings, give students the opportunity to find resources not included in the curriculum, and help keep them appropriately paced.

One point of focus I'm grateful for is career building; several early checkpoints are devoted to honing the student's vision of the future, revealing the realities and breadth of the web development industry. It felt almost overwhelming, and during my bootcamp, several checkpoints have already been broken down and spaced out to give the student more time to read and consider their options, and more direction in doing so. I look forward to bridging the frontend functionality covered so far with backend technologies like Ruby, and continuing further on the job hunting path, bringing my understandings to a marketable baseline and realizing the benefits of my studies.
