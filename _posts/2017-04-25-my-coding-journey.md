When computers were first popular and affordable, I was in preschool, and took an early interest in computer gaming. In grade school, this interest developed to encompass computer hardware, as a gaming enthusiast with a grade schooler's budget, and by the age of 12, I did the necessary research to build my own desktop. Around the same time, I practiced creative writing, and began looking into basic HTML and CSS to style my own blog, as well as an amateur gaming website that never quite came to fruition.

As my studies veered off in humanities-related directions, my interest in web development idled for a few years, before picking up again to help my parents cultivate their own online presences and stimulate their businesses. Throughout this process, I acquainted myself with Javascript, PHP and SQL, in order to set up a back-end blog posting system without the aid of popular blogging platforms like Wordpress, and I settled on the idea of being a professional web developer. Still hanging onto my long-time hobby of poem-writing (my main collegiate focus), I put together a Javascript- and PHP-based writing blog, implementing a hidden registration/login feature as an exercise with PHP, but never found the time to fully populate it with writing. After a few years of miscellaneous, collegiate and independent studies on several tracks and my few, personal site-building projects, I began researching official coding bootcamps. My goal was to find an online program with flexible pacing but a set schedule, and preferable conferences with professors/teachers to keep me focused and timely.

Throughout my studies at Bloc, I've patched some of my Javascript foundations and delved into the concision-based library JQuery, as well as the streamlined, synchronous Angular, and Google's simple database system Firebase, all of which I hope to implement on my personal websites, which I will include here.

My main point of intrigue, new languages aside, is Bloc's career finding element. Bringing my potential futures to light and focusing on the reality of being a web developer is invigorating, and stimulates my studies.
