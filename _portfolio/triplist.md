short-description: Use Triplist to make the perfect Spotify playlist for your roadtrip.

---

For my capstone project for Bloc's Part-Time Web Developer bootcamp, I built Triplist, a Ruby-on-Rails-based app that builds you the perfect playlist for your road trip.

To use Triplist, you need to authenticate yourself with Spotify, granting Triplist the right to create and modify playlists for you.

To create your playlist, enter the length of your road trip, or calculate your travel time by car with Google Maps Directions. Next, choose the source of your playlist's music: recommendations based on up to three genre choices, recommendations based on an artist, your 300 most-recent saved tracks, or your top 50 most-played tracks for the last 6 months.

Enjoy your playlist! You can browse songs with a built-in Spotify widget, and play the song in your Spotify application by pressing play.

You can browse all of your Triplist playlists by following "My Playlists" in the navigation bar.
