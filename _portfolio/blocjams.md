short-description: BlocJams is an awesome music player!

Bloc students, to practice Javascript and JQuery, and to introduce AngularJS, build a simple Spotify-style music library with the Buzz engine, consisting of a landing page, album list, and album song list with a functional music player, which plays, pauses and skips, tracking play progress with a working seek bar.

For lack of song and album work, we loaded 12 iterations of the same album in the Collection page, but a richer body of album templates would load correctly, were the information input in "fixtures.js".

Aside from basic layout and loading of album templates, the only complications were with the functionality of the player bar, which updates with the playing song's name, artist, album, total time and time elapsed. The player bar allows you to seek by dragging the seek thumb to your desired time, just as the volume slider allows you to set the current volume.
